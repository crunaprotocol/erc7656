### isTransferable

```solidity
function isTransferable(uint256 tokenId, address from, address to) external view returns (bool)
```

Used to check whether the given token is transferable or not.
If this function returns `false`, the transfer of the token MUST revert execution.

 interacting with this function SHOULD NOT rely on it as it is not mandated by the proposal.
